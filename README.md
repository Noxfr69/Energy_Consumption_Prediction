# Energy Consumption Prediction

## Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for a machine learning project aimed at predicting energy consumption. The project employs supervised learning models, hyperparameter optimization, feature engineering, and SHAP for model interpretability.

## Features

### Supervised Learning
- Various supervised learning algorithms are used to predict energy consumption, including Lasso, Ridge, Random Forest, SVR, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost.

### Feature Engineering
- Advanced feature engineering techniques are employed to improve the model's predictive performance.

### SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)
- SHAP is used to interpret the model and to understand the importance of each feature.
